# CryoHackathon 2023 ❄️🧊🏔️🐧

Welcome to the first edition of the CryoHackathon organised by the Early Career Glaciologist Group (EGG) of the International Glaciological Society (IGS) from February 17th to 19th 2022! :partying_face: :partying_face:

The goal of this event is first for all participants to have fun collaborating together on exciting projects linked to the cryosphere during a exciting weekend, in a nice and inclusive atmosphere! Anyone is more than welcome to participate, and no coding experience is required! 😃

If you are not registered yet and would like to participate, don't hesitate to [fill this form](google.com)! :writing_hand:

# Format :computer:

The format is very simple! :nerd_face: 

Teams from 1 to 5 participants will work on a cryosphere-related project of their choice during this CryoHackathon! This project can be buit from scratch, inspired from the pool of ideas listed further below, picked within existing projects or even as part of a course project! You can basically choose to work on anything as long as there is a slim link to the cryosphere! Again, **the primary goal is for everyone to have fun in a nice and inclusive atmosphere!** 😃

# Schedule :calendar:

  - **4:30pm UTC** Presentation by the Sentinel Hub team, partner of this event
  - **5:00pm UTC** Final team building and start of the projects!

- **Saturday September 18th** 
  - **10:00am UTC** Coffee break with the mentors and the organising team for those who could use some extra motivation, help or simply would like to change their mind for a moment!
  - **04:00pm UTC** Another break with the team to get boosted for the Saturday night hack!

# CryoHackathon Challenges 📢

An option is to go for one of the three challenges listed below that
we created for this Hackathon! Those are only ideas, they can be starting points for your own ideas and can easily all three be merged into one if you feel like it!

## CryoObs 🧐

Pick the frozen area of your choice (glacier ice, snow, sea ice, permafrost...), and study how it is evolving through time! This could be a study area you particularly like, one you're currently studying, always wanted to or realized it's hasn't really been investigated in the past... Just pick the one you like! 😃  For your case study, you could then use a variety of data sets from satellite data to model results and reanalyses! Here again, no coding experience is required: you could decide to manually outline and/or track features, or even go for a report/literature review on the different studies and associated knowledge gaps in this area!

## CryoKey 🗘

You've always been interested in this one process but never had time/the opportunity to study it in detail? Here's your chance! You can develop your own small research project focused on process understanding and see how far you get during the Hackathon! Interesting fact is that many small projects initiated during hackathons end up way bigger after the event and can sometimes even be the starting point for large collaborations, this could be the case for yours! 

## CryoTech 💾

You're into algorithm, method and/or software development and want to use your skills to create a new tool applied to cryospheric sciences! This could be a detection algorithm, a graphical user interface, a model (or anything else!)... Just get started and have fun! 


# Inter-Community Challenges 📢

## [The Polar EO database](https://github.com/APECS-Earth-Observation/Polar-EO-Database)

The remote sensing working group of the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) is currently developing a database with the aim of making the access, download and overall use of satellite data easier! To this end, they are currently gathering info about all satellites used in polar sciences and are building this very useful resource! You could contribute to this project by adding new satellites and/or missing information!

# Communication 💬
Communication between the organisers, the mentors and the participants will
primarily take place on the [IGS EGG Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/824997204921810984/824998700668551178), more specifically
in the `#cryohackathon22` channel. Don't hesitate to use it to
communicate with your team too!

# Useful tools 🛠️

Sentinel Hub, our awesome partner for this first edition of the CryoHackathon, is kindly prodiving **a free Sentinel Hub account to all participants during the Hackathon!** :partying_face: :partying_face:

- [Sentinel Hub EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser): an efficient and easy-to-use graphical user interface to browse through Sentinel, Landsat and many other satellite data sets. Images over your study area can also be downloaded directly on this platform.

- [Earthspy](https://github.com/AdrienWehrle/earthspy): A Python wrapper package to make the download of satellite data easier. In 3 lines of Python code, you can download data from your small study area on a specific date to worldwide data sets throughout the satellite era!

- [Climate Copernicus Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home): A web interface to easily download widely used data sets such as ERA5, ESA land cover products and many satellite-derived !

# Mentors 👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👨🏽‍💻

We created an awesome team of mentors who will do their best to help you as much as possible in your project if you feel the need for it! Don't hesitate to contact them before, during (and even after!) the Hackathon! They are here to help and possibly give you an outside perspective on your ideas!

## Adrien Wehrlé [@AdrienWehrle](https://github.com/AdrienWehrle)
Adrien is a PhD student at the University of Zurich, Switzerland where he's studying the dynamics of Greenland outlet glaciers as well as the evolution of the surface process across the ice sheet. He's into anything coding, software and algorithm development data science, machine learning and so on! He's also the developer of [Earthspy](https://github.com/AdrienWehrle/earthspy) so don't hesitate to ask him any question if you're considering using it!
