* CryoHackathon Challenges

I think it's important to say there is no restriction but we give few ideas. I
thought about three main "themes": 1) study area 2) process and 3) method
(titles should be improved, but just to give you an idea)

** CryoObs 

pick a glacier or any frozen area (sea ice, snow, permafrost..), maybe one that
hasn't been studied a lot, and study how it has been changing recently (or less
recently). Kind of a case study. Could be done with reanalyses, sat data,
etc.. but IMO it's important to say that *no* coding experience is required. It
can be manual work (outlining etc..) or even a report/literature review without
any coding involved!

** CryoKey

Maybe some participants have a process they want to study in mind. At the
global, region, glacier scale, whatever they want! (Just have fun!!)

** CryoTech

Maybe some participants want to develop a method to detect features, the
occurrence of a process and again at different scales.

As you can see those three ideas are only here to give some starting points so
the participants who don't have a clear idea yet don't feel lost (although those
ideas should be nicely presented, here are just notes at the moment). Also, they
are closely linked to each other and can be fully coupled. E.g. focusing on a
precise process on a given glacier and developing a method for its
detection/monitoring (1, 2 and 3)! To me, the point is to guide potential
undecided people efficiently without putting any constraints.
